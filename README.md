Hi there, I'm Lazaros Savvidis,
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm currently deep-diving into the world of Artificial Intelligence for my PhD at the University of Nicosia. To say I'm excited about AI would be an understatement – I'm absolutely fascinated by it!

AI is this huge, ever-changing field, and there's so much out there yet to explore. I'm doing my bit by focusing on a really cool aspect – a new approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It's tricky, but hey, that's what makes it fun, right?

I'm all about sharing ideas and learning from others. If you've got any thoughts, suggestions, or just want to chat about AI stuff, I'm all ears. And hey, if my work sparks an idea for someone else and leads to something amazing, I'll be over the moon!

Feel free to poke around my projects and drop a line if anything catches your eye. Thanks for stopping by, and let's make something awesome together!
