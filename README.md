Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm Lazaros, and I'm currently working on my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Nicosia. I find AI really exciting and am passionate about it.

AI is a big and ever-changing area with a lot to discover. My research is about a new way to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) â€“ it's a tough problem, but I enjoy the challenge. 

I am also dedicated to discovering innovative solutions and ideas that can significantly enhance our daily lives, focusing on practical applications that offer tangible benefits and improvements.

I believe in sharing knowledge and learning from others. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or want to talk about AI, I'd love to hear from you. If my research can inspire or help others in any way, that would be fantastic!

Feel free to look through my projects and get in touch if you find something interesting. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope we can work on something great together!
